    Athanor is an open-source library and toolkit built atop of Evennia for
    the purpose of easing the process of building all sorts of multi-player
    online text games (MUD, MUX, MUSH, MUCK and other MU*). Modules are provided
    that make the experience much more similar to traditional MUDs and MUSHes than
    the tools Evennia provides out of the box, from communication tools to common
    RPG design patterns such as Equipment slots and Inventory control. Athanor gets
    its name after the alchemist's furnace, as it hopes to refine the things that
    Evennia is already great into something even grander.
